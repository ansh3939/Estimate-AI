## EMI Calculator Implementation

### 1. Core Financial Calculations

#### EMI Formula Implementation
```
Monthly EMI = P × r × (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)

Where:
P = Principal loan amount
r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12)
n = Total number of months (tenure × 12)
```

#### Advanced Calculations
- **Total Interest**: Comprehensive interest computation over loan tenure
- **Total Amount**: Principal + Total Interest payable
- **Monthly Interest Component**: Detailed breakdown per payment
- **Principal Component**: Reducing balance calculations

### 2. Amortization Schedule Generation

#### Detailed Payment Breakdown
For each month, calculate:
- **Opening Balance**: Remaining principal amount
- **EMI Payment**: Fixed monthly installment
- **Interest Portion**: Interest on opening balance
- **Principal Portion**: EMI - Interest portion
- **Closing Balance**: Opening balance - Principal portion

#### Visual Representation
```
Month | Opening Bal | EMI    | Interest | Principal | Closing Bal
------|-------------|--------|----------|-----------|------------
1     | 50,00,000   | 47,905 | 41,667   | 6,238     | 49,93,762
2     | 49,93,762   | 47,905 | 41,615   | 6,290     | 49,87,472
...   | ...         | ...    | ...      | ...       | ...
240   | 47,546      | 47,905 | 396      | 47,509    | 0
```

### 3. Prepayment Analysis Engine

#### Savings Calculation Algorithm
```python
def calculate_prepayment_savings(principal, rate, tenure, prepay_amount, prepay_month):
    original_total = calculate_total_payment(principal, rate, tenure)
    
    # Reduce principal at prepayment month
    new_principal = remaining_balance_at_month(principal, rate, prepay_month) - prepay_amount
    remaining_months = (tenure * 12) - prepay_month
    
    new_total = calculate_total_payment(new_principal, rate, remaining_months/12)
    savings = original_total - new_total - prepay_amount
    
    return savings
```

#### Benefits Analysis
- **Interest Savings**: Quantified reduction in total interest
- **Tenure Reduction**: Months saved from loan term
- **Break-even Analysis**: Optimal prepayment timing
